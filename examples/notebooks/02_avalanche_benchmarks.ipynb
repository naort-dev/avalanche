        "\n",
        "* By `Dataset` we mean a **collection of examples** that can be used for training or testing purposes but not already organized to be processed as a stream of batches or tasks. Since Avalanche is based on Pytorch, our Datasets are [torch.utils.Datasets](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/utils/data/dataset.html#Dataset) objects.\n",
        "* By `Scenario` we mean a **particular setting**, i.e. specificities about the continual stream of data, a continual learning algorithm will face.\n",
        "* By `Benchmark` we mean a well-defined and carefully tought **combination of a scenario with one or multiple datasets** that we can use to asses our continual learning algorithms.\n",

        "\n",
        " * **Single-Incremental-Task Scenario (SIT)**: In this scenario we have just a *single task*, hence the continual stream of data is defined in batches rather than tasks.\n",
        " * **Multi-Task Scenario (MT)**: In this scenario we encounter a sequence of tasks. Of course only encontering examples of new classes makes sense here.\n",
        " * **Multiple-Incremental-Task Scenario (MIT)**: In this scenario a sequence of tasks is encountered over time. However, the same task may appear more than once in the sequence. This is the most realistic yet unexplored setting in litterature. Encountering examples of new as well as old classes is possible here.\n",
