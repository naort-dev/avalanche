    "In this brief tutorial we will understand how we can install the *Avalanche* package in our computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Avalanche* has been designed for extreme portabily and usability. Indeed, it can be run on every os and native python environment. The *Avalanche* dependencies are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python>=3.6** *(it may work on lower versions as well but we don't officially support it, nor recommend it.)*\n",
    "* **typing-extensions**\n",
    "* **psutil**\n",
    "* **torch**\n",
    "* **torchvision**\n",
    "* **tensorboard**\n",
    "* **scikit-learn**\n",
    "* **matplotlib**\n",
    "* **numpy**\n",
    "* **pytorchcv**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to install *Avalanche* we have two main options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing it with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)\n",
    "2. Istalling it with [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)"

    "This is the safest option since it allows you to build an isolated enviroment for your Avalanche experiments. This means that you'll be able to pin particular versions of your dependencies that may differ from the ones you want to maintain in the rest of your system. This will in turn increase reproducibiluity of any experiemnt you may produce.\n",
