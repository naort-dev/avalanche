# Request a Feature

We try to keep the design of _Avalanche_ as _open_, _collaborative_ and _inclusive_ as possible.

This mean discussing _Avalanche_ issues, development and future ideas openly through general [ContinualAI projects meetups](https://www.continualai.org/news/#meetup), its [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/continualai/shared_invite/enQtNjQxNDYwMzkxNzk0LTBhYjg2MjM0YTM2OWRkNDYzOGE0ZTIzNDQ0ZGMzNDE3ZGUxNTZmNmM1YzJiYzgwMTkyZDQxYTlkMTI3NzZkNjU), [Github](https://github.com/vlomonaco) and [forum](https://continualai.discourse.group).

If you'd like to add a new feature to _Avalanche_ please let us know, so we can work on it, or team up with you to make it a reality! ðŸ˜„

Features request can be opened on Github as Issues with appropriate "feature-request" tag: more voted features will be implemented first!
