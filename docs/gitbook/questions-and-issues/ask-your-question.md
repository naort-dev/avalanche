# Ask Your Question

We know that learning a new tool may be tough at times. This is why we are here to help you üôè

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't be afraid to ask questions, there are no stupid questions and we will always answer to you.
{% endhint %}

However, in order to help you, we need you to help us first.   
  
First of all, if the question is more of a _code issue_ or a _feature request_, **please use** [**GitHub**](https://github.com/vlomonaco/avalanche) **for them**.  
If instead, this is a _general question about Avalanche_, in this case you can ask us directly [on slack](https://join.slack.com/t/continualai/shared_invite/enQtNjQxNDYwMzkxNzk0LTBhYjg2MjM0YTM2OWRkNDYzOGE0ZTIzNDQ0ZGMzNDE3ZGUxNTZmNmM1YzJiYzgwMTkyZDQxYTlkMTI3NzZkNjU) \(\#avalanche channel\) for a quick one or on [our forum](https://continualai.discourse.group), using the "_**avalanche**_" tag.  
  
In any case, please make sure to follow the steps below:

1. _Clarify your information needs._
2. _Formulte them coherently._
3. _Check if the same question or a related one can be found._
4. _Ask your question._

Then we will try to answer as swiftly as possible! ü§ó
