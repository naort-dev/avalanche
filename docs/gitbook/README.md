# Avalanche: an End-to-End Framework for Continual Learning Research

![](.gitbook/assets/avalanche_logo_with_clai.png)

**Avalanche** is an _end-to-end Continual Learning research_ framework based on [**Pytorch**](https://pytorch.org/), born within [**ContinualAI**](https://www.continualai.org/) with the unique goal of providing a **shared** and **collaborative** open-source **codebase** for _fast prototyping_, _training_ and _reproducible_ _evaluation_ of continual learning algorithms. 

Avalanche can help _Continual Learning_ researchers in several ways:

* _Shared, easy-to-use & coherent codebase_
* _Writing less code, prototype faster & introduce less bugs_
* _Improve reproducibility_
* _Improve modularity and reusability_
* _Increased efficiency & portability_
* _Augment impact and usability of your research products_

The framework is than split in three main modules:

* **`Benchmarks`**: This module maintains a uniform API for data handling: mostly generating a stream of data from one or more datasets. It contains all the major CL benchmarks \(similar to what has been done for [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html)\).
* **`Training`**: This module provides all the necessary utilities concerning model training. This includes simple and efficient ways of implement new _continual learning_ strategies as well as a set pre-implemented CL baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms you will be able to use for comparison!
* **`Evaluation`**: This modules provides all the utilities and metrics that can help evaluate a CL algorithm with respect to all the factors we believe to be important for a continually learning system. It also includes advanced logging and plotting features, including native [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) support.

_Avalanche_ is one of the first experiments of a **End-to-end Research Framework** for reproducible m_achine learning_ research where you can find _benchmarks_, _algorithms_ and _evaluation protocols_ **in the same place**.  
  
Let's make it together üë´ a wonderful ride! üéà

## üö¶ Getting Started

We know that learning a new tool _may be tough at first_. This is why we made _Avalanche_ as easy as possible to learn with a set of resources that will help you along the way.  
  
For example, you may start with our _**5-minutes**_ **guide** that will let you acquire the basics about _Avalanche_ and how you can use it in your research project:

We have also prepared for you a large set of _**examples & snippets**_ you can plug-in directly into your code and play with:

Having completed these two sections, you will already feel with _superpowers_ ‚ö°, this is why we have also created an **in-depth tutorial** that will cover all the aspect of _Avalanche_ in details and make you a true _Continual Learner_! üë®‚ÄçüéìÔ∏è

_Avalanche_ is the flagship open-source collaborative project of [**ContinuaAI**](https://www.continualai.org/#home): _a non profit research organziation and the largest open community on Continual Learning for AI_. __

The _Avalanche_ project is maintained by the collaborative research team [_**ContinualAI Research \(CLAIR\)**_](https://www.continualai.org/research/)_._ We are always looking for new _awesome members_, so check out our official website if you want to learn more about us and our activities.
