# Learn Avalanche in 5 Minutes

_Avalanche_ is mostly about making the life of a continual learning researcher easier. 

> #### What are the **three pillars** of any respectful continual learning research project?

* **Benchmarks**: Machine learning researchers, need datasets and benchmarks with efficient and easy-to-use data handling utils to design and prototype new algorithms. Quantitative results on ever-changing benchmarks has been one of the driving forces of _Deep Learning_.
* **Training**: ****Efficient implementation and training of continual learning algorithms; comparisons with other baselines and state-of-the-art methods become fundamental to asses the quality of an original algorithmic proposal.
* **Evaluation**: ****_Training_ utils and _Benchmarks_ are not enough alone to push continual learning research forward. Comprehensive and sound _evaluation protocols_ and _metrics_ need to be employed as well.

> #### _With Avalanche, you can find all these three fundamental pieces together and more, in a single and coherent codabase._

Indeed, these are the _three main modules_ offered in the _Avalanche_ package.

## üì¶ How to Install Avalanche

_Avalanche_ can be installed as simply as:

```text
pip install git+https://vlomonaco:****@github.com/vlomonaco/avalanche.git
```

You can check if the installation was successful importing the package in python with:

```text
import avalanche
avalanche.__version__
```

## üìö Benchamarks

The benchamark module offers three main features: 

1. **Datasets**: a comprehensive list of Pytorch Datasets ready to use \(It includes all the _Torchvision_ Datasets and more!\).
2. **Classic Benchmarks**: a set of classic Continual Learning Benchmarks ready to be used.
3. **Generators**: a set of functions you can use to generate your own benchmark startin from any Pytorch Dataset!





## ü§ù Run it on Google Colab

You can run _this chapter_ and play with it on Google Colaboratory:
