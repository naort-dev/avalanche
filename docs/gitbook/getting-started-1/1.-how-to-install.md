# How to Install

{% hint style="danger" %}
At the moment the packaged version of the framework **are not available** as mentioned in the following content. Please just follow the instructions installing [Anaconda in _developer-mode_](1.-how-to-install.md#install-avalanche-with-anaconda).
{% endhint %}

_Avalanche_ has been designed for extreme **portability** and **usability**. Indeed, it can be run on every OS and native python environment. üíªüçéüêß

In order to install _Avalanche_ we have two main options:

1. [Installing it with Anaconda](1.-how-to-install.md#install-avalanche-with-anaconda).
2. [Installing it with Pip.](1.-how-to-install.md#installing-avalanche-with-pip)

## üîÇ Avalanche Dependencies

The _Avalanche_ dependencies are the following:

`python>=3.6`, `typing-extensions`, `psutil`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `tensorboard`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pytorchcv`, `quadprog`, `tqdm`, `googledrivedownloader`.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Avalanche may work on lower Python versions as well but we don't officially support it, nor recommend it._
{% endhint %}

All the dependencies **will be installed automatically for you** in both the **Anaconda** and **Pip** installation.

## üêç Install Avalanche with Anaconda 

This is the safest option since it allows you to build an isolated environment for your Avalanche experiments. This means that you'll be able to pin particular versions of your dependencies that may differ from the ones you want to maintain in the rest of your system. This will in turn increase reproducibility of any experiment you may produce.

If you have already an environment you can install it with `conda` as follows:

```bash
conda install -c continualai -c pytorch avalanche
```

We recommend to use _Anaconda_ especially if you want to expand _Avalanche_ and help us improve it \(see the "[_From Zero to Hero_](../from-zero-to-hero-tutorial/2.-benchmarks.md)" Tutorial\). In this case we suggest to create an environment in _**developer-mode**_ as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlomonaco/avalanche.git
cd avalanche
conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
conda activate avalanche-dev-env
```

## üì¶ Installing Avalanche with Pip 

Within an Anaconda environment or not you can install _Avalanche_ also with Pip. In this case installing it is as simple as:

```bash
pip install git+https://vlomonaco:****@github.com/vlomonaco/avalanche.git
```

```bash
import avalanche
avalanche.__version__
```

That's it. now we have _Avalanche_ up and running and we can start using it!

## ü§ù Run it on Google Colab

You can run _this chapter_ and play with it on Google Colaboratory:
