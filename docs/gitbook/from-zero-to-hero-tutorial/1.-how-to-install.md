# 1. How to Install

_Avalanche_ has been designed for extreme portabily and usability. Indeed, it can be run on every OS and native python environment. The _Avalanche_ dependencies are the following:

`python>=3.6`, `typing-extensions`, `psutil`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `tensorboard`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pytorchcv`

{% hint style="info" %}
_Avalanche may work on lower Python versions as well but we don't officially support it, nor recommend it._
{% endhint %}

In order to install _Avalanche_ we have two main options:

1. Installing it with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
2. Istalling it with [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

## üêç Install Avalanche with Anaconda 

This is the safest option since it allows you to build an isolated enviroment for your Avalanche experiments. This means that you'll be able to pin particular versions of your dependencies that may differ from the ones you want to maintain in the rest of your system. This will in turn increase reproducibiluity of any experiemnt you may produce.

If you have already an eviroment you can install it with `conda` as follows:

```bash
conda install -c continualai -c pytorch avalanche
```

We recommed to use Anaconda especially if you want to expand _Avalanche_ and help us improve it \(see chapter 6 and 7 of this tutorial\). In this case we suggest to create an evironment in "_developer-mode_" as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlomonaco/avalanche.git
cd avalanche
conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
conda activate avalanche-dev-env
```

## üì¶ Installing Avalanche with Pip 

Within an Anaconda enviroment or not you can install _Avalanche_ also with Pip. In this case installing it is as simple as:

```bash
pip install git+https://vlomonaco:****@github.com/vlomonaco/avalanche.git
```

```bash
import avalanche
avalanche.__version__
```

That's it. now we have _Avalanche_ up and running and we can start using it!

## ü§ù Run it on Google Colab

You can run _this chapter_ and play with it on Google Colaboratory:
