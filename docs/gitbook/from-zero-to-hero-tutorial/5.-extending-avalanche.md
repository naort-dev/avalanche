# 5. Extending Avalanche

Having learned how to use all the _Avalanche_ main features, you may end up willing to customize the framework a little to suit your eagerness of continually better functionalities \(as a true _continual learner_ would indeed do! âš¡\).

Hence, now is the time to get your hands dirty! ðŸ™Œ 

Take you time to explore the [Avalanche API](https://vlomonaco.github.io/avalanche) in great deatail. We made sure everything is well documented \(even if improvable\), but make sure to take a look at the code as well to resolve any uncertainties.

You can start by cloning the repo and installing the requisites for the "_developer_" mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlomonaco/avalanche.git
cd avalanche
conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
conda activate avalanche-dev-env
```

We suggest to delve into the code using an appropriate IDE, such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). This will help you navigate the code better and with tons of cool discovery features.
