# Benchmarks

_Avalanche_ offers significant support for _defining your own benchmarks_ (instantiation of one scenario with one or multiple datasets) or using "**classic" benchmarks** already consolidate in the literature.

You can find **examples** related to the benchmarks here:&#x20;

* [Classic MNIST benchmarks](../../../examples/all\_mnist.py): i_n this simple example we show all the different ways you can use MNIST with Avalanche._
* __[_SplitCifar100 benchmark_](../../../examples/lamaml\_cifar100.py)_: in this example a CIFAR100 is used with its canonical split in 10 experiences, 10 classes each._
* __[_CLEAR benchmark_](../../../examples/clear.py)_:_ training and evaluating on CLEAR benchmark (RGB images)
* [CLEAR Linear benchmark](../../../examples/clear\_linear.py): Training and evaluating on CLEAR benchmark (with pre-trained features)
