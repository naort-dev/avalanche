# Benchmarks

_Avalanche_ offers significant support for _defining your own benchmarks_ (instantiation of one scenario with one or multiple datasets) or using "**classic" benchmarks** already consolidate in the literature.

You can find **examples** related to the benchmarks here:&#x20;

* [Classic MNIST benchmarks](../../../examples/all\_mnist.py): _In this simple example we show all the different ways you can use MNIST with Avalanche._
* __[_SplitCifar100 benchmark_](../../../examples/lamaml\_cifar100.py)_: In this example a CIFAR100 is used with its canonical split in 10 experiences, 10 classes each._
