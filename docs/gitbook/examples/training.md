# Training

_Avalanche_ offers significant support for _training_ (with _templates_, _strategies_ and _plug-ins_). Here you can find a list of **examples** related to the training and some strategies available in Avalanche (each strategy reproduces original paper results in the [CL-Baselines](https://github.com/ContinualAI/continual-learning-baselines) repository:&#x20;

* [AR1 strategy](../../../examples/ar1.py): This is a simple example on how to use the AR1 strategy.
* [CoPE Strategy](../../../examples/cope.py): this is a simple example on how to use the CoPE plugin. It's an example in the online data incremental setting, where both learning and evaluation is completely task-agnostic.
