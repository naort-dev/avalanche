# AvalancheDataset

The `AvalancheDataset` is an implementation of the PyTorch `Dataset` class that comes with many useful out-of-the-box functionalities. For most users, the _AvalancheDataset_ can be used as a plain PyTorch Dataset that will return `x, y, t` elements. However, the AvalancheDataset is much more powerful than a simple PyTorch Dataset.

**A serie of **_**Mini How-Tos**_ will guide you through the functionalities of the _AvalancheDataset_ and its subclasses:

* [Preamble: PyTorch Datasets](https://avalanche.continualai.org/how-tos/avalanchedataset/preamble-pytorch-datasets)
* [Creating AvalancheDatasets](https://avalanche.continualai.org/how-tos/avalanchedataset/creating-avalanchedatasets)
* [Advanced Transformations](https://avalanche.continualai.org/how-tos/avalanchedataset/advanced-transformations)

Brefore jumping to the actual _Mini How-To_s, **we recommend having a look at the basic notions of Dataset and DataLoader by reading the** [**Preamble page**](https://avalanche.continualai.org/how-tos/avalanchedataset/preamble-pytorch-datasets).
