# How to Install

_Avalanche_ has been designed for extreme **portability** and **usability**. Indeed, it can be run on every OS and native python environment. üíªüçéüêß

In order to install _Avalanche_ we have three main options:

1. [Installing it with Pip](how-to-install.md#installing-avalanche-with-pip)
2. [Developer Mode Install](how-to-install.md#developer-mode-install) (for contributing to _Avalanche_!)

{% hint style="info" %}
_Avalanche may work on lower Python versions as well but we don't officially support it, nor recommend it._
{% endhint %}

At the moment, we cannot provide a swift installation experience as some of the dependencies cannot be installed automatically. However, in the sections below we detail how you can install Avalanche **in a matter of minutes** on any platform!

## üì¶ Installing Avalanche with Pip

you can install Avalanche with pip:

```bash
pip install avalanche-lib
```

That's it. Now you can start using Avalanche!

1.

## Using Anaconda

```bash
# choose your python version
python="3.8"

# Step 1
git clone https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche.git
cd avalanche
conda create -n avalanche-env python=$python -c conda-forge
conda activate avalanche-env

# Step 2
# Istall Pytorch with Conda (instructions here: https://pytorch.org/)

# Step 3
conda env update --file environment.yml
```

{% hint style="info" %}
On **Linux**, alternatively, you can simply run the `install_environment.sh` in the _Avalanche_ home directory. The script takes 2 arguments: `--python` and `--cuda_version`. Check `--help` for details.
{% endhint %}

You can test your installation by running the `examples/test_install.py` script. Make sure to include avalanche into your **$PYTHONPATH** if you are running examples with the command line interface.

## üíª Developer Mode Install

If you want to expand _Avalanche_ and help us improve it (see the "[_From Zero to Hero_](../from-zero-to-hero-tutorial/03\_benchmarks.md)" Tutorial). In this case we suggest to create an environment in _**developer-mode**_ as follows (just a couple of more dependencies will be installed).

Assuming you have **Anaconda (or Miniconda) installed** on your system, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Install the `avalanche-dev-env` environment and activate it.
2. [Install Pytorch + TorchVision](https://pytorch.org) (follow the instructions on the website to use conda).
3. Update the Conda Environment.

These three steps can be accomplished with the following lines of code:

```bash
# choose you python version
python="3.8"

# Step 1
git clone https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche.git
cd avalanche
conda create -n avalanche-dev-env python=$python -c conda-forge
conda activate avalanche-dev-env

# Step 2
# Istall Pytorch with Conda (instructions here: https://pytorch.org/)

# Step 3
conda env update --file environment-dev.yml
```

{% hint style="info" %}
On **Linux**, alternatively, you can simply run the `install_environment_dev.sh` in the _Avalanche_ home directory. The script takes 2 arguments: `--python` and `--cuda_version`. Check `--help` for details.
{% endhint %}

You can test your installation by running the `examples/test_install.py` script. Make sure to include avalanche into your **$PYTHONPATH** if you are running examples with the command line interface.

That's it. now we have _Avalanche_ up and running and we can start contribute to it!

## ü§ù Run it on Google Colab
